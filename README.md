This repo contains the chat logs between a team member (Polux Gabriel Garcia Elizondo, the writer of this) and ChatGPT3.5 for the 2014 Sample Paper for Methods of Mathematical Physics, taught at the University of Edinburgh.

The files are organized into three individual folders, one per question, and contain both the raw .txt file given by OpenAI and a pre-formated pdf file to improve the reading experience.
There is also a combined pdf should one wish to have all three questions in a single pdf.

There are likely still to be errors, however, in the PDF the only thing from ChatGPT's responses that were modified was anything necessary for the PDF file to load properly. The .txt files are completely unmodified, however.

Also, there was no space in the report to mention this, but progressively my patience dwindled after many hours of trying to wrangle ChatGPT in an attempt for it simply even provide a semblance of a correct answer.
Could this have affected the efficacy of ChatGPT? Probably.
Substantially? Probably not.
Regardless, more, paid, research, will be needed for further conclusions to be made.

-=Special Thanks=-

I'd like to just very quickly thank Kristel Torokoff for graciously letting us use her 2014 paper to plug into ChatGPT. 
Her solutions as well were highly helpful in cross-checking some of ChatGPT's solutions,
without requiring me to sit another exam to derive the steps & solutions myself.
